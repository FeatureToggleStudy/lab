a core breakdown in scientific communication is lossy compression of claims

recovered by the entire audience

Once a reader has connected all necessary information for understanding a claim, they donâ€™t have a fast, flexible way to capture, combine, extend, recover, or share those connections. When readers become authors, they are forced to compress unconnected information to fit the medium and the cycle continues. 

enabling 1) faster capture of connections made while reading publications, 2) flexible management of those connections in a personal knowledge graph, and 3) linking specific parts of user generated content, such as phrases in scientific claims, to relevant parts of the knowledge graph.
