react-hot-boilerplate
=====================

**adapted from https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/**

The minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React components.

Based on the guide available at https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/

### Usage

```
yarn install
yarn start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `src/App.tsx`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).

### Building

A basic production script is included that builds your app to a `dist` folder

```
yarn build
```
